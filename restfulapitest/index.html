	  <h2>About the API</h2>
	  <p>
		  The API is a RESTful web service, allowing control of one or more Systems.  
		  A truly RESTful interface relies on a Resource Oriented
		  Architecture, and the Manager API does that.  Calls are made to different URIs 
		  depending on which resource is being accessed.  Different HTTP methods are 
		  used, in accordance with REST principles:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Retrieve a representation of a resource: HTTP GET</li>
		  <li>Create a new resource: HTTP PUT to a new URI, or HTTP POST to an existing URI</li>
		  <li>Modify an existing resource: HTTP PUT to an existing URI</li>
		  <li>Delete an existing resource: HTTP DELETE</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		  The main resources handled by the API are Systems, Nodes, Users, Backups,
		  Monitors, Commands/Tasks.  Each has a page where you can run the various API requests.
		  In addition to the information provided here, you can go to any installation of the
		  API and request http://example.com/path/to/api/metadata to obtain information about
		  the entities handled by the API and the legal requests that can be made to the API.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Because the API is potentially open to the public internet and is managing critical
		  resources, it is secured to limit acccess.  Please read the security section
		  below before attempting to use the API independently of this front end.
	  </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="section">
	  <h3>Resources Managed by the API</h3>
	  <p>
		  Up to now, the main resources that are understood by the API are:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Systems (which also have properties)</li>
		  <li>Nodes</li>
		  <li>Users (which also have properties)</li>
		  <li>Backups</li>
		  <li>Monitor Classes</li>
		  <li>Monitor Instances (which have sets of data associated with them)</li>
		  <li>Commands</li>
		  <li>Tasks</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		  Subsidiary resources are really just lookups for short codes, and they
		  can be processed on the related main resource page:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Backup possible states</li>
		  <li>Node possible states</li>
		  <li>Command possible states</li>
		  <li>Command steps</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		  An oddball that does not altogether fit with the scheme but is included
		  on the Commands page is:<br />
		  bucket<br /><br />
		  There is also an API call on the Commands page to run SQL (limited to 
		  SELECT or SHOW) on the database. Details of the main resources follow.
		  Almost all the main resources can be created, updated or deleted through the API.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Systems</h4>
	  <p>
		  A system is a group of nodes that run database servers in a linked way
		  so as to produce a single integrated database service.  The use of
		  multiple nodes is aimed at solving problems of availability, scaling and load handling.
		  Connected resources are system properties, which are name-value pairs
		  associated with a particular system. For details of 
		  <a href="http://manager.skysql.com/system" rel="metadata/entity/system.html">
			system data
		  </a> click on the link.  Note that this includes derived
		  information - only the basic system information can be directly modified
		  through the API.  System properties can be modified through the API, but
		  require a different URI from updates to the basic system fields - see the
		  system page for details.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Nodes</h4>
	  <p>
		  A node is a single &quot;machine&quot; that is part of a system.  It is
		  typically a virtual private server (or VPS) and may be provisioned by
		  the use of cloud services.  Nodes can typically be started and stopped
		  (either deliberately or by accident) without bringing down the system.
		  For details of 
		  <a href="http://manager.skysql.com/node" rel="metadata/entity/node.html">
			node data
		  </a> click on the link. Note that this includes derived
		  information - only the basic node information can be directly modified
		  through the API.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Users</h4>
	  <p>
		  The API allows users to control the system, and provides user
		  authentication.  For details of 
		  <a href="http://manager.skysql.com/user" rel="metadata/entity/user.html">
			user data
		  </a> click on the link.  Note that there are two related but 
		  separate API interfaces for updating this data - one for the basic user 
		  data and one for the user properties.  See the user page for details.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Backups</h4>
	  <p>
		  Access to iinformation about currently existing backups of system and nodes is available
		  through the API. For details of 
		  <a href="http://manager.skysql.com/backup" rel="metadata/entity/backup.html">
			backup data
		  </a> click on the link.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Monitors</h4>
	  <p>
		  Many different kinds of monitor are possible. The API maintains a list of them.
		  For details of 
		  <a href="http://manager.skysql.com/monitor" rel="metadata/entity/monitor.html">
			monitor data
		  </a> click on the link.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Commands</h4>
	  <p>
		  Running a command creates a task.  The Task page provides a list of the
		  available commands with their descriptions.  When a command is issued, a 
		  number of parameters can be supplied.  Details of the 
		  <a href="http://manager.skysql.com/monitor" rel="metadata/entity/command.html">

	  <h3>Configuring the API</h3>
	  <p>
		  There is a configuration file that provides some basic information
		  for the API and allows some defaults to be set.  It is located in
		  /etc/mariadbmanager/manager.ini and as distributed contains the following
		  information:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; About manager.ini ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;
; The manager's initialization file, called manager.ini, is responsible for
; configuring basic aspects of the Manager components - the API, the UI, the
; Monitor and the execution package (e.g. GREX).

; Manager components look for this file in /etc/mariadbmanager
;
; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and lines
; beginning with a semicolon or hash are silently ignored (as you probably 
; guessed).
;
; Directives are specified using the following syntax:
; directive = value
; For strings, quotes are optional
; For numbers, quotes are optional
; Directive names are case sensitive - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.
; However, key words such as True or None are not case sensitive
; Directives are variables used to configure Manager components.
; There is no name validation.  If the Manager can't find an expected
; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value may be used,
; or in the case of essential information such as API keys, the Manager will
; fail to function.
;
; The standard installation process will create a valid manager.ini file that
; can then be customised as required.
;
; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values On, True or Yes.
; They can be turned off using the values Off, False or No.
;
; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal
; sign, or by using the None keyword:

;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string
;  foo = None    ; sets foo to an empty string
;  foo = "None"  ; sets foo to the string 'None'
;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Common data - required on every machine that runs a Manager component ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;
; The API keys section provides security for calls to the API
;
; An arbitrary number of keys can be specified.  Each key must be assigned
; to an integer, which is the API Key ID.  Corresponding to the ID is
; the actual API Key.  It can be any arbitrary string of 32 characters - a
; convenient way to create meaningless keys is to take the MD5 hash of some
; random text.
;
; Each piece of software that uses the API should have its own ID and key.

2 = "c15fa645cddc2adb0a2c6bdd13874182"
;
; The API host section tells Manager components where to find the API.
; When all components run on the same machine, localhost can be used, but 
; if the components are deployed on different machines then an IP address or
; a hostname that can be resolved is required

	  <p>
		  The path to the SQLite database could be different, but will be set by the 
		  provisioning system.  User and password are not required so long as SQLite is
		  used for the administration database.  The API will write log records using the
		  syslog daemon and will write details of errors to the ErrorLog table in the
		  administration database.  If an email address is provided in erroremail, the 
		  errors will be mailed to that address.  The shell path defines how system 
		  calls will be handled by the API.
	  </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="section">
	  <h3>Securing the API</h3>
	  <p>
		  The API is running on a server that may be open to the world.  It is therefore
		  undesirable for just anyone to be able to use the API.  To constrain use of
		  the API, some additional headers need to be sent with each request.  The 
		  headers used are the standard HTTP headers Date and Authorization.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  The Date header should be set with an RFC-2822 date; PHP will provide it
		  with a call to date(&#039;r&#039;).  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  The Authorization header is just a little more complicated.  One element is
		  the use of an API key.  The API has a configuration file, /etc/mariadbmanager/manager.ini.
		  Within the configuration file is an apikeys section which contains one or more
		  integers to which are assigned long random strings.  Typically, these are
		  32 character strings created by applying MD5 to some random text string.  But
		  any string of 32 ASCII characters will do.  The integer will be part of the 
		  authorization header and it will be stored in the log with brief information
		  about each request to the API.  So it is possible to use a number of different
		  API keys to track use of the API by different mechanisms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  To create the Authorization header, first obtain the RFC-2822 date mentioned above
		  and the request URI, trimmed of any leading and trailing slashes.  The request
		  URI is the part of an absolute URI that comes after the domain.  For example,
		  the request URI for http://example.com/system/123 is the string &quot;/system/123&quot;.
		  Trimmed of leading and trailing slashes, it is &quot;system/123&quot;.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  The code string needed for authorization is then calculated by first concatenating these
		  three items and then calculating the MD5 hash of the concatenation:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>The trimmed request URI</li>
		  <li>The selected API key string</li>
		  <li>RFC-2822 Date</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		  Once the hashed code string has been formed, the whole Authorization header is obtained
		  by concatenating the following strings (the first is the literal text required):
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>api-auth-</li>
		  <li>the integer corresponding to the chosen API key, as a string, e.g. 1</li>
		  <li>a hyphen</li>
		  <li>the hashed code string computed as above</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		  The full header will then be something like:<br />
		  Authorization: api-auth-1-38ef94d18a0680c227a1f48d4072e9f9
	  </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="section">
	  <h3>Installation</h3>
	  <p>
		  The code can be obtained from the MariaDB downloads area, see 
		  <a href="http://www.mariadb.com">http://www.mariadb.com</a> for details.  
		  The files should be placed in a directory within the web server's document 
		  root.  The directory structure must be preserved.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  There is a configuration file called manager.ini.  This is in the directory ../root/etc/mariadbmanager of the
		  structure in the repository.  It should be checked and modified to suit local
		  requirements.  In particular, the API keys should be changed in order to secure
		  the API.  The file must be moved to /etc/mariadbmanager/manager.ini so that it cannot be
		  served to the web and so that it can be found by the API.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Another critical aspect to installing the API code is setting up Apache 
		  mod_rewrite (or its equivalent).  Any URI that does not correspond to an actual
		  file or directory should be rewritten to point to the api.php file in the root
		  of the API directory structure.  The neatest arrangement is to install the API 
		  code into a subdomain so that it is at the document root for the subdomain.  
		  In that case, typical rewriting rules for Apache are:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) /api.php [L]
	  </pre>
	  <p>
		  If the API code has to be placed in a subdirectory of the Apache document root,
		  then the last line of the rewrite rule should be altered accordingly.  This will
		  prevent rewriting taking place outside the API directory.  The rules
		  would then be:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(/some/directory/.*) /some/directory/api.php [L]
	  </pre>
	  <p>
		  Depending on the web server configuration, it may also be necessary to use URI
		  rewriting to ensure the HTTP headers are available to the API. For PHP running as
		  CGI, this requires something like:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTPHTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE:%{HTTP:If-Modified-Since}]
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH:%{HTTP:If-None-Match}]
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE:%{HTTP:Content-Type}]
