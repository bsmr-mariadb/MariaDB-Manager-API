	  <h2>About the API for the SkySQL Cloud Data Suite</h2>
	  <p>
		  The API is a RESTful web service, allowing control of one or more SkySQL
		  Cloud Systems.  Calls are made to different URIs depending on which resource
		  is being accessed.  Different HTTP methods are used, in accordance with 
		  REST principles:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Retrieve a representation of a resource: HTTP GET</li>
		  <li>Create a new resource: HTTP PUT to a new URI, or HTTP POST to an existing URI</li>
		  <li>Modify an existing resource: HTTP PUT to an existing URI</li>
		  <li>Delete an existing resource: HTTP DELETE</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		  The main resources handled by the SCDS API are Systems, Nodes, Users, Backups,
		  Commands and Jobs.  Each has a page where you can run the various API requests.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Installation</h3>
	  <p>
		  The code can be extracted from the SkySQL repository.  Currently it is found at
		  bzr+ssh://repository.skysql.com/bzr/admin_php/restfulapi.  The files should be 
		  placed in a directory within the web server's document root.  The directory 
		  structure must be preserved.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  There is a configuration file called api.ini.  This is in the root of the
		  structure in the repository.  It should be checked and modified to suit local
		  requirements.  In particular, the API keys should be changed in order to secure
		  the API.  The file must be moved to /etc/scdsapi/api.ini so that it cannot be
		  served to the web and so that it can be found by the API.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  One element of api.ini is the directory given in the logging section.  Provided
		  this points to a directory that can be written by the web server, the API will
		  log some of its actions to a file called api.log.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Another critical aspect to installing the API code is setting up Apache 
		  mod_rewrite (or its equivalent).  Any URI that does not correspond to an actual
		  file or directory should be rewritten to point to the index.php file in the root
		  of the API directory structure.  Typical rewriting rules for Apache are:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) /index.php [L]
	  </pre>
	  <p>
		  Depending on the web server configuration, it may also be necessary to use URI
		  rewriting to ensure the HTTP headers are available to the API. For PHP running as
		  CGI, this requires something like:
	  </p>
	  <pre>
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE:%{HTTP:If-Modified-Since}]
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH:%{HTTP:If-None-Match}]
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	  </p>

	</div>
    </body>
