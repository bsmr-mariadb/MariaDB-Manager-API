 * The Request class is the main controller for the API.
 * 
 * The $uriTable array defines the API RESTful interface, and links calls to
 * classes and methods.  The Request class puts this into effect.
 * 
 * The constructor splits up the model URIs into their constituent parts.
 * 
 * The doControl method first fetches the request URI and extracts the relevant
 * part, then explodes it into parts.  Then the request URI is compared with 
 * the model URIs to find what is to be done (or an error return).
 * 
 * The sendResponse method is provided for the benefit of the classes that 
 * implement the API.
