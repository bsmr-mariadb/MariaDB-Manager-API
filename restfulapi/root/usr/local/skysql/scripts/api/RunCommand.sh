# This script is called by the MariaDB Manager API to run jobs remotely on a node of a given cluster.
#
# Parameters:
# $1 The ID of the job that is to be run
# $2 A comma separated list of steps (each being a script)
# $3 The hostname for the API - unused
# $4 Parameters to be passed on to step scripts
# $5 The IP of the node on which to run the command
# $6 The path of the log file - unused
#
# NB Paramter 3, api_host is not used any more as the idea has been superceeded
# in favour of dynamically defining it. This works better when mutliple network
# interfaces are in use.
# Also argument 6 is no longer used as all logging is done to syslog
